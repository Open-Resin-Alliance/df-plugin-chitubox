 * CHITUBOX does not encode a support as a chain. Its reader walks a flat record
 * array and rebuilds structure geometrically, and the records themselves are
 * emitted out of order (a pillar can appear after the tips that reference it,
 * and unrelated supports interleave). The only connectivity in the file is
 * coincidence: two records belong to the same support when they share an
 * endpoint, exactly.
 *
 * So the honest model is an undirected graph:
 *
 *   nodes  = distinct endpoints (quantised; real coincidences are exact)
 *   edges  = shaft-like records (sub 1, 2, 3, 12)
 *   caps   = sphere records (sub 7, 8, 9) decorating the node at their CENTRE
 *   anchors= feet (sub 5) and bases (sub 4) pinning whichever node they touch
 *
 * A node of degree > 2 is a branch point -- the multi-tip junction, falling out
 * of the structure rather than needing a special case.
 *
 * Note that a sphere record is a DIAMETER segment: its two endpoints are
 * opposite poles, so the joint sits at their midpoint, which in turn lands on a
 * shaft endpoint.
